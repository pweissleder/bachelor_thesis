# Framework for Performant, Modular and Reliable Smart Home Applications

## Abstract 

The field of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is gaining relevance in industry and academia. One of the various CPS application areas is the Smart Home, which aims to control, monitor, and manage smart devices and systems within a home or building. Cyber-Physical Systems, and in particular Smart Homes, are characterized by a heterogeneous environment with diverse standards and protocols across all system layers. This presents significant barriers to the wider adoption of Smart Homes, especially for commercial applications where the cost-effective development of performant and reliable solutions is essential.
Despite the availability of frameworks and platforms for other CPS application areas, industry solutions and research results in the Smart Home domain are often limited to domestic consumer products, limited prototypes, or niche solutions. This thesis aims to address this gap by proposing a framework that facilitates the development and operation of Smart Home applications for various use-cases.
The thesis provides an overview of the diverse CPS and Smart Home domains through multiple abstractions. Furthermore, an emphasis was placed on identifying key requirements of the proposed framework, with a particular focus on non-functional requirements. The framework was conceptualized and developed, then evaluated through an alternative im- plementation of a smart home business application and by conceptualizing an additional framework adaptation.
Findings indicate that applications developed with the framework require less development effort, facilitating a greater focus on device integrations, use-case-specific services, and user interfaces, and are reliable.

## Framework and Unicorn+ 
The framework is tested by the prototype implementation of the Unicorn Application. The Implementation can be found in this repository. 
The subsequent README files contain additional setup information.
